//QUESTION: Select your favorite product. You can work with the one product file you used in the last worksheet #6.

//Examine the review_body column in the amazon reviews file for a product of your choice.
//Remove all commas, dots, semicolons, and these stopwords:  and or if in it.
//Remove all html tags, such as <br />
//You can search for <.../> with sed.
//Keep only the review_body column and output to a new file.

//Steps taken:
//All of these were done using a pipe, so its all one command
//I used awk '$4 == ID' to choose only the relevant reviews of the product
//Then I used 'cut' to only choose the review body, on the 14th column
//Then, using sed and 's/,//g' or 's/<or/>//g' I removed commas dots semicolons and stopwords from above
//Another 'sed' command was used to remove html tags, though I'm not sure this particular product had them
// 'sed 's/<[^>]*>//g'
//Finally, the output was put into the file REVIEWS.0060193395.txt in the PRODUCTS directory
